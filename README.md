Roommate Matching Algorithm
This is a Python script that implements a roommate matching algorithm. Users are represented by a User class, which has fields for their name, age, gender, and preferences. The calculate_match_score function takes two users as input and returns a score based on the number of preferences they have in common. The find_best_match function takes a user and a list of users as input and returns the user with the highest match score. The script also includes some sample users to test the algorithm with.

How to Use
To use the algorithm, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. You can then run the script by typing the following command in a terminal window:

Copy code
main.py
The script will output the match scores for each user in the sample list.

Dependencies
The script has no external dependencies and should run as-is with a standard Python 3 installation.

Setup
To set up the script on your own machine, you can either download the files directly from GitHub or clone the repository using Git.
